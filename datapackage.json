The 'Other' Region category includes all cases that are not being served by a Regional DCF Office. This includes cases being served as/by Aftercare, General Administration, Treatment Services, Special Investigations Unit, DCF Hotline, or cases that have not been assigned to a DCF Regional office as of the date of observation.

In Special Study cases, a child may be placed in a foster home where the providor is not a member of the child's family, but has some meaningful connection to the child, and in most cases is recruited, trained, licensed and supported by the DCF directly. Cases listed here as PDC or Safe Home refer to placements in either a Permanency Diagnostic Center (not utilized since 2011) or a DCF Safe Home. The DCF High Meadows facility was closed in 2009, and as such no further cases are listed in the data. The Solnit Center includes its North Campus (formerly CT Children's Place) and South Campus (formerly Riverview Psychiatric Hospital). Independent Living placement includes DCF programs such as Supportive Work, Education, and Transition Programs (SWET) and Community Housing Apartment Programs (CHAP).",
